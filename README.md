# DataLyaerEF
This solution demonstrates one of the approach to organize Data Layer using Entity Framework. The main idea is using objects states.
All operations implemented in ContextWrapper and programmer doesn't know anything about it. He just uses generic repository to perform
all operations.

This solution not workable, uses only for demonstrate goals to avoid complexity.
